# RSS Blogroll

A simple RSS reader (written in Haskell btw)

## Demo (my personal blogroll)

The RSS reader is automatically deployed to: **https://unorsk.github.io/blogroll/**



### My todo list. Sort of.

- [ ] Make adding new items to the blogroll easy (I just wanted to add this one: https://anchor.fm/s/10395bc40/podcast/rss)
- [ ] The renderHtml and generateOpmlXml functions - use xml-conduit or lucid instead of concatenating strings (security)
- [ ] Would be nice if it could understand stuff like `<itunes:explicit>`
- [ ] Make it possible to use custom fonts
- [ ] ...and styles
